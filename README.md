# Faster-rcnn-tensorflow

## Abstract
This is a tensorflow re-implementation of Faster rcnn by LongJun
[Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)

Train on VOC2007 trainval and test on VOC2007 test, the mean_ap is 71.0%
Train on VOC2007+VOC2012 trainval and test on VOC2007 test, the mean_ap is 
(You can change the train set and test set for more results)

# My Development Environment
1.python 3.6(anaconda recommend)
2.cuda9.0
3.opencv(cv2)
4.tfplot(You might need to install this lib by pip)
5.tensorflow==1.9
